    \section{Introduction}

    The main goal is to implement an audio fingerprinting system that can identify the original track from different audio samples.
    The audio samples are divided in four types: clean samples, filtered samples, noisy samples, noisy filtered samples. These samples
    are short exctracts from the original tracks, adding filters or noise to test the system in harsh conditions.

    \vspace{1em} To the implementation a library of fourty audio files have been used. Each audio file counts with four samples of the previously 
    commented types (clean, filtered, noisy and noisy filtered). This means a total of sixteen samples per original audio file.

    \vspace{1em} The work includes the development of two tools: builddb and identify.
    \begin{list}
        \item builddb: takes the original audios and creates a database with the fingerprint information.
        \item identify: takes a sample and matches the result against the database to return the corresponding original track.
    \end{list}

    \subsection{Technologies used}
    
    After reading the Shazam paper \cite{ShazamAlgorithmPaper} I could imagine an application with a lot of recursivity in the main tasks 
    (reading files, processing files etc.). In programming recursivity usually means computationally demanding, so I tried to avoid slow 
    interpreted languages like Python. The language chosen has been C# \cite{PythonVsCSharp} with the SDK .NET 9.0. The main reason to use this 
    language is that is an object-oriented high-level compiled language. It cheked the application demandings, fast and counts with high-level 
    tools to perform the desired tasks.

    The main packages used for the implementation are:
    \begin{list}
        \item NAudio: library for working with audio files, playback, recording, and processing.
        \item NWaves: digital signal processing (DSP) library for audio analysis.
        \item MessagePack: compact binary serialization format for data exchange.
    \end{list}

    \section{Implementation}

    The implementation is based on the Shazam algorithm \cite{ShazamAlgorithmPaper} and it is divided in two different tools: builddb 
    and identify. Each tool has been developed in a separated C# module \ref{fig:builddb_identify_block_diagram}.

        \caption{Modules builddb and identify work flow}
        \label{fig:builddb_identify_block_diagram}
    \end{figure}

    The main idea of this process is to split each audio file in small samples and generate a hash for each one. This hash is based on the 
    magnitude peaks as a representative characteristic of the sample. This is done for each audio file and all the hashes are stored in a file 
    that works as a database. During the identification, the same process is carried out with the provided audio sample and then the resultant 
    hashes are collated with the database.
